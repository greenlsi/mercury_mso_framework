# Mercury M&amp;S&amp;O Framework for Fog Computing

Mercury is a Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization (M&amp;S&amp;O) Framework that aims to facilitate the fine-grained dimensioning and operation tasks of fog computing infrastructures.

Mercury's networking model is inspired by the 5G standard. It gathers Software-Defined Network (SDN) functions, radio bandwidth sharing algorithms, and access points discovery processes inspired by the 5G New Radio (NR) standard. Optimization tools allow you to automatically redistribute Radio Access Points and Edge Data Centers to reduce the negative effects of hot spots in your scenario.

With Mercury, you can explore real-time aspects of fog computing, such as perceived latency or power consumption of the infrastructure. Besides, different visualization tools are also provided. All the output is gathered in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files for further analysis.

The code is fully written in Python 3, enabling you to override pre-defined models using your favorite Python packages (NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, etc.). Mercury is built on top of [xDEVS](https://github.com/jlrisco/xdevs), a DEVS-compliant simulator.

# How to Get the Code?

Although we want to publish the code as open-source, we are still working on a first solid version with enough documentation and samples for easing its usage, and therefore no code is available yet. However, if you want us to send a preliminary version of Mercury, feel free to [send an email](mailto:r.cardenas@upm.es) with your request.
